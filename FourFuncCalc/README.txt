This is a readme I'm including for my project.
Everything should be included in the build path for the project and I ran it and it compiled and worked fine on my machine (Ubuntu 12.04), so hopefully no issues arise.

The Answr button allows you to get the result of the previous expression.
The Clear button clears the screen.

Thats it! Thanks!
